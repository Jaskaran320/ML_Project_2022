# Abstract



Cardiovascular diseases (or heart diseases) are the
leading cause of death worldwide, with around 18 million deaths yearly. Several diagnosis methods are available worldwide, but they are expensive in terms of time,
money and personnel. The motivation for our project is
to conduct data analysis and build classification models using machine learning techniques to help practi-
tioners make more accurate decisions regarding class
fying heart diseases. We aim to combine multiple models
for data analysis and perform relevant model evaluation
techniques to present a proper, functioning model.
